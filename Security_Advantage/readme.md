# Project Description

This project was created to simulate stock market ticker that emulates real time second price changes. It is based off of historical data from 3/15/2022 to 12/09/2022. Each tick is two days.

I created this project with a focus on Javascript Classes. I used setTimeout() to run a loop that would stream over 1000 lines of historical stock data and emulate a stock market ticker.

Then within that Class, I created methods that would allow for the Class to buy and sell stocks as well as make updates and append data to the html screen.

TLDR: Project created to emulate stock market bot.

# How to set up and use this project

## If you would like to skp the api setup, scroll down farther or click [SKIP API](#skip-api)
You will need to setup an api key for this all to work. It is very simple to do and takes only a few seconds. However, I have already provided two forms of data that can be used to test the application if you feel like this step is not needed, you can skip.

Go to rapidapi.com and create a free portfolio or connect your github then head to the link below and get your api
[API HERE](https://rapidapi.com/alphavantage/api/alpha-vantage)
Underneath Code Snippets where the drop down is, make sure to select Javascript and Axios and that should be the correct API.

# SKIP API

Once the application has been downloaded onto your computer. Open VS Code and once you are inside of the applications directory, open the vs terminal (git bash was what I was using) and run 'npm install' - This will ensure all of the necessary dependencies are installed. Now you can open index.html in a live server in VS code (or another way but I used VS Code) and run it.
